## Introducci贸n

```{r bibliotecas, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

packages <- c("tidyverse","RSQLite","knitr","kableExtra")
if (length(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages()))) > 0) {
  install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())), repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com") 
}

sapply(packages, require, character.only=TRUE)

```

Iniciemos creando una conexi贸n al archivo SQL

```{r conexion, echo=TRUE}
mydb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "my-db.sqlite")
dbListTables(mydb)
dbListFields(mydb, "salesman")
```

## Tablas

```{r tablas1, echo=FALSE}
dbGetQuery(mydb, 'SELECT * FROM salesman') %>%
  kable(caption="salesman") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 5)
```


```{r tablas2, echo=FALSE}
dbGetQuery(mydb, 'SELECT * FROM customer') %>%
